# C Programming Lab Submission

This repository contains the solutions for my C Programming lab assignment. Each program is designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts like loops, pointers, recursion, and functions.

## 📋 Table of Contents
1. **Binary Converter**: Converts a number to binary using loops.
2. **Vowel & Consonant Counter**: Uses pointers to count characters in a string.
3. **Menu-Driven Calculator**: Implements addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using functions.
4. **Diamond Pattern**: Prints a diamond shape using nested loops.
5. **String Length**: Calculates string length using pointer arithmetic.
6. **GCD Calculator**: Finds the Greatest Common Divisor using recursion.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the `.c` files.
2. Compile using a C compiler (GCC):

   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
