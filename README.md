# C Programming Lab Submission

This repository contains the solutions for my C Programming lab assignment. Each program is designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts like loops, pointers, recursion, and functions.

## 📋 Table of Contents
1. **Binary Converter**: Converts a number to binary using loops.
2. **Vowel & Consonant Counter**: Uses pointers to count characters in a string.
3. **Menu-Driven Calculator**: Implements addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using functions.
4. **Diamond Pattern**: Prints a diamond shape using nested loops.
5. **String Length**: Calculates string length using pointer arithmetic.
6. **GCD Calculator**: Finds the Greatest Common Divisor using recursion.
7. **Studentaveragemarks**:finds the average of the students.
8. **Car rental rate**:finds rental rate of 3 cars
9. **SUM and Multiply of complex numbers**: finds sum and multiplication of complex numbers
10. **Employee Details** :finds and stores employee details and give us back
11. **Store and Print Array Elements**:This program takes input from the user, stores the values in an array, and prints all the elements
12. **Display Array in Reverse Order**:This program reads n elements into an array and prints them in reverse order.
13. **Sum of All Array Elements**:This program calculates the sum of all elements present in an array.
14. **Count Total Duplicate Elements**:This program counts how many duplicate elements exist in an array
15. **Print All Unique Elements**:This program prints only those elements that appear exactly once in the array.
16. **Insert an Element at a Given Position**:This program inserts a new element at a specified position in an array by shifting the existing elements to the right.
17. **Delete an Element at a Given Index**:This program removes an element from a specific position by shifting the remaining elements to the left.
18. **Merge Two Arrays**:This program combines two separate arrays into a single array by copying elements of both arrays into a third array.
19. **Transpose of a matrix**: program to find transpose of a matrix using sparse matrix
20. **addition of a matrix**:adding of two matrices using sparse matrices
21. **additon of two polynomials**:program for adding two polynomials
22. **multiplicaion of two polynomials**:doing multiplication of two polynomials by taking inputs
23. **implementation of stacks**:knowing how to implement a stack from stratch
24. **infix to postfix**:using stacks turning infix expression to postfix expression
25. **infix to postfix using parenthesis**:tells us how to convert infix expression to postfox expression which contain parenthesis
26. **postfix to result**:after we got postfix expression we should need to get result for that so this tells us how from a postfix expression we can get result
## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the `.c` files.
2. Compile using a C compiler (GCC):

   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
